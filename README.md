# The Clique-Picking Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Clique-Picking algorithm that we have proposed at AAAI 2021 [1] for counting the number Markov Equivalent DAGs in polynomial time. The paper and its appendix is available on arXiv [2].

## AAAI 2021 Experiments
The implementation we used in [1] can be found under [aaai_experiments](/aaai_experiments). This folder also contains some of the graphs we used in the experiments.
